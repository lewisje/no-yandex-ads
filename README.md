# No Yandex Ads
This UserScript removes ads in Yandex search, because Yandex inserts its ads in such a random manner that Adblock Plus rules are useless against them; this fork of [Lain Inverse's script](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/809-no-yandex-ads) tries to support even older browsers that do not natively implement mutation observers.
